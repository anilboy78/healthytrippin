      There are some restaurants and hotels which are providing Indian flavours
      in this area. Tandoori Nights and Rasoi are two of them and I have also
      visited these restaurants but found out that they are not serving dishes
      in proper Indian flavour. This encourage me to bring real Indian food in
      this area which will help me to become unique in this area. Secondly, food
      truck eliminate the need of food delivery. Because food truck can be taken
      to anywhere. Fresh food can be cooked at the customer’s location which
      will also give satisfaction to the customers as they will witness the
      cooking process of the food and will not have any hygiene issues. We can’t
      be so sure about the big restaurants hygiene levels as they have their
      kitchens where they cook the food behind the walls. Food trucks can also
      eliminate the catering services for the small functions like birthdays and
      office party’s. This will also help my food truck to get some fame from
      the guests in party. People will come to my food truck for my services as
      every ingredient which I use in my food will be Organic.
