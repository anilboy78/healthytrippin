### Socially responsible

Every firm need to be socially responsible. Most of the old firms are becoming socially responsible for example google is using electricity from there own solar farms. My firm will also be socially responsible as it will be open for public. I have already planed that my food truck will server the best, organic and healthy food to the customer and will be cooked at the customers place so it will also be hygienic so customers will be aware about the hygiene quality of the food. I will also make sure that all the food items, which I will have on my food truck, will be mention on my food menu with the entire ingredients used in the food item so that customers are aware that what they are going to eat. Sometimes customers may have allergies to the ingredients we used in specific item so it will be good to have the ingredient in the menu. I will also install solar panels on my truck so that I can save natural resource of energy.

#### Will your company be an early mover, an early follower, or a late follower? Explain why.

I am planning to start my business of food truck because here in Sault Ste. Marie we do not have any food truck so it means I want to be an early mover. As I will be the owner of the first food truck, I will have the monopoly in the market. It will also beneficial because the first mover if get any success that will last longer then any other successful company because the impact they make as the first mover. For example, everyone in Sault Ste. Marie will know my food truck as we only have one in the city and after seeing my success any other competitor try to come in the market my truck will already be there with huge market share. Therefore, it will be great to be the first mover. Followers may have an idea about the type of customers and the market. However, they will also have to face the competition in the market. They need to work hard to stand in the market as the customers already have an option in the market. Followers would not get the market share easily.
