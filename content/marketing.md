I am planning to distribute my food truck pamphlets before starting my business. So that people in this area became aware that something new is going to open in the area. I will also promote my business on the social media few days before starting my food truck. It will help my business to get some boost and recognition in the market. And I will also take customers review that where they want me to bring my food truck for them. Which can also effect my business in positive way. I will consider the most asked places for the first few days to see the response from the market.

I am targeting every foodie person in my business but my main target would be those who would love to try the new food items and the Indians staying in the Sault Sainte Marie. As I am aware of the fact that in Sault Sainte Marie we Indians are not able to find a good quality food. We only have 2 or 3 options to go for. I want to be new and permanent option for them so they donâ€™t need to look for the other options. I will also be targeting the customers who are not able to eat food in big restaurants as I will be offering food as the most reasonable price I can offer with the minimum profit.
