Risk

The biggest risks food trucks are facing every day

Without proper coverage, food trucks leave themselves exposed to scenarios and lawsuits that could easily end their business before it even takes off.

Vehicle-related dangers

No matter how careful food trucks operators are, no on can control mother nature. Natural disasters are common and outdoor elements such as hail, snow, lightning, heavy rainfall, and wind disturbances all pose a major threat to food truck businesses. The damages incurred from these events are costly and can have a long-term effect on operations by forcing temporary closures, which means there could be massive amounts of foregone revenue.

Car Accidents

According to Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), more than 4,000 lives are lost in crashes involving large trucks or buses each year. And compared to other automobiles, the fatality rate for large trucks is 50 percent higher than normal vehicles. Road safety applies to all, but food trucks are more susceptible for these kinds of accidents that a typical car.

Operational Risks

Although safety precautions must be practiced at all times, work-related accidents like slips and falls, smoke inhalation, burns, wounds, and heat stroke can still happen from day-to-day operations. In a workspace like a food truck, there are a lot of accidents that can arise in smaller spaces.

Food Spoilage and Fire Hazards

Unlike traditional restaurants, food trucks don’t have the convenience of spacious food storage. A single handling mistake may cause health-alarming issues such as food contamination and food poisoning. Additionally, the constant motion and jarring of food truck can affect the structural integrity of the systems in place from fryers to refrigerators.

Food truck insurance—What coverage is recommended?

To ensure complete protection and reliable peace of mind, food truck operators need to make sure they have insurance in place that will safeguard the financial assets of their businesses. Although services and products differ, there are insurance policies tailored made to cater to the specific needs of food truck businesses.

Commercial Auto

One of the most important policies for food truck owners is commercial auto, which should be purchased as soon as the truck is acquired. It offers coverage for bodily injury, personal injury, and physical damage caused by accidents involving the business automobile.

General Liability + Commercial Property

Providing protection from third-party bodily injury, property damage, and personal or advertising claims, general liability is the foundation of all business insurance. Paired with commercial property, it protects the physical assets of the food truck such as tools and equipment needed for operation. These two insurance policies can be bundled in one convenient package called Business Owner Policy (BOP), and most insurance carriers will typically offer them at a discounted rate when they are bought together.

Workers Compensation

Protecting employees from work-related injuries and accidents by covering medical fees as well as lost wages, workers compensation is mandatory in most states. For the employer’s part, this policy also defends them from expensive and damaging lawsuits related to negligence. 

Umbrella Insurance

Umbrella insurance offers an extra layer of protection to ensure there are no gaps between policies. It provides an additional level of financial security when all resources from existing policies have been reached or depleted. It also increases limits so food truck owners don’t have to pay excess liabilities.
