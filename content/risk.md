# Risks

**Vehicle-related dangers**

No matter how careful food trucks operators are, no on can control mother nature. Natural disasters are common and outdoor elements such as hail, snow, lightning, heavy rainfall, and wind disturbances all pose a major threat to food truck businesses. The damages incurred from these events are costly and can have a long-term effect on operations by forcing temporary closures, which means there could be massive amounts of foregone revenue.

**Car Accidents**

According to Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), more than 4,000 lives are lost in crashes involving large trucks or buses each year. And compared to other automobiles, the fatality rate for large trucks is 50 percent higher than normal vehicles. Road safety applies to all, but food trucks are more susceptible for these kinds of accidents that a typical car.

**Operational Risks**

Although safety precautions must be practiced at all times, work-related accidents like slips and falls, smoke inhalation, burns, wounds, and heat stroke can still happen from day-to-day operations. In a workspace like a food truck, there are a lot of accidents that can arise in smaller spaces.

**Food Spoilage and Fire Hazards**

Unlike traditional restaurants, food trucks donâ€™t have the convenience of spacious food storage. A single handling mistake may cause health-alarming issues such as food contamination and food poisoning. Additionally, the constant motion and jarring of food truck can affect the structural integrity of the systems in place from fryers to refrigerators.
