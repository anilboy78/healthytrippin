It was always my dream to be in the food business so if I am getting a chance to be in this industry then providing best quality food will be my first preference. I have also decided my brand name is going to be Healthy Trippin. I will always have organic food in my food truck which will also include Indian flavoured cooked food so it will be heathy as it will be organic and new as there are very few Indian restaurants in this area. I will not be aiming any specific type of customers infect all people around this area will be in my customer range so I will try to cook in different styles. In terms of pricing I will go for the best price I could offer with having a very little margin as my profit. As my business is a moving food shop (Food Truck) it will be plus point for me to take my food to the maximum number of customers. I could take my food truck to the big events in the city where they can taste my food.
