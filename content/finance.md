_These are the basic things which I need to purchase while starting my business. The main and most expensive item would be the food truck itself which will cost me $85000 once. Cooking utensils are also cost me more in start because at that time I need to buy all the utensils at start but after 1st month it will only cost me very less every month. I will also have salary for myself as I will be working full time on my truck. Other than these truck maintenance, Licenses and insurance will also cost me monthly._
